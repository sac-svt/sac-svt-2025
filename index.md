## Call For Papers

The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists from different areas of computing for over thirty years. 
The forum gives participants an opportunity to interact with different communities sharing an interest in applied computing.

[The 40th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2025)](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2025/) is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will take place on March 31 - April 4, 2025, at the University of Catania, Sicily.

The Software Verification and Testing track aims to contribute to the challenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software engineering. 
The track covers areas such as formal methods for verification and testing, based on theorem proving, model checking, static analysis, and run-time verification. 
We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and testing, as well as development of technologies to improve the usability of formal methods in software engineering. 
We also welcome detailed descriptions of applications of mechanical verification to large scale software.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- model checking
- theorem proving
- correct by construction development
- model-based testing
- software testing
- symbolic execution
- static and dynamic analysis
- abstract interpretation
- analysis methods for dependable systems
- software certification and proof carrying code
- fault diagnosis and debugging
- verification and validation of large scale software systems
- real world applications and case studies applying software testing and verification
- benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification

## Submission Guidelines

Paper submissions must report on original, unpublished work. 
Submitted papers will undergo a double-blind review process. 
Author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be avoided and made in the third person. 
We welcome research papers and posters. 
Research papers should have at most 8 two-column pages in ACM format (further two pages, to a total of 10 pages, may be available at a charge). 
The length of a poster is limited to 2 pages (one extra page may be available at a charge). 
Please comply to this page limit already at submission time.

Furthermore, in the context of the Student Research Competition (SRC) program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest, graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (single author, maximum of 3 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the instructions published at the SAC 2025 website. 
Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings in the ACM digital library. 
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. 
An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. 
This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. 
No-show of registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM digital library.
